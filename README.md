# EnQuad-a-QKD-Simulator
EnQuad is meant to be a universal Quantum Cryptography simulator to help researchers implement Quantum Key Distribution in a much quicker manner.
It directly guides the researcher through some important physical parameters to reach a given target secret-key rate. 
It is originated from a paper that will shortly be under review for approximately one month. 
Once the paper gets published, I will attach a link to it for more details on how and when to use EnQuad version 1.0.
However, you can now start trying EnQuad by running EnQuad_Main function that links all functions.
