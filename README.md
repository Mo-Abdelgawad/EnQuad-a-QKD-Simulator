# EnQuad-a-QKD-Simulator
EnQuad is meant to be a universal Quantum Cryptography simulator to help researchers implement Quantum Key Distribution in a much quicker manner.
It directly guides the researcher through some important physical parameters to reach a given target secret-key rate. 
It also performs security tests and helps the researcher with which reconciliaiton protocol he should use in his experimental setup.
A detailed paper has been accepted in Cybernetics and information technologies (CIT) Jounral. Once it is available online, I will attach the link here. 
However, you can now start trying EnQuad by running EnQuad_Main function that links all functions.
